# `SYS4INI.BIN` and `.AII` files

These files contain the metadata of the files is packed in the `.ALF` files.

- `SYS4INI.BIN` ususally from the original game. It usually contains metadata for the `DATA1.ALF`, `DATA2.ALF`, etc. files.
- `.AII` files will have accompany file with the same name with the `.ALF` extension. They are from append contents (`APPEND01`, `APPEND02`, etc).

# `.ALF` files

These files only contain the archive entries data back by back. It contains no file name, offset, size so that is why we need the `.AII` files or `SYS4INI.BIN` file to extract the contents.

# `.AGF` files
